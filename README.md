# 🐾 Katto
**Terminal Social Chat**

Bringing people together, one message at a time. A modern, Discord-like chat application built entirely for the terminal using Textual.

## 📝 About
Katto is a full-featured terminal chat application that brings real-time messaging to your command line. Built with Python and [Textual](https://textual.textualize.io/), it provides a modern, interactive TUI experience comparable to desktop chat clients like Discord, but entirely within your terminal. Perfect for developers, sysadmins, and terminal enthusiasts who want to stay connected without leaving their shell.

## ✨ Features
- **Modern TUI:** Beautiful, interactive interface that feels like a modern web app but lives in your terminal.
- **Global & Private Rooms:** Chat in `#general`, `#coding`, `#gaming`, etc.
- **Direct Messaging:** Send DMs privately to other users.
- **Friend System:** Send friend requests, accept/decline, and see who is online.
- **Live Updates:** See when other users are typing and get real-time message updates via WebSockets.
- **Slash Commands:** Fully powered by `/commands` for easy navigation and power use.

## 🛠️ For Developers: Running the Server

Katto is a client-server application. By default, the client connects to the cloud server, but you can run your own server locally for development.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- MongoDB (for local development)
- pip / pipenv

### Local Server Setup
1. Navigate to the `server/` directory:
   ```bash
   cd server
   ```

2. Install backend dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure MongoDB is running locally (or update the connection string in the server code).

4. Start the local server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The server will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

5. Update the client to use your local server:
   - Edit `client/app.py` and change `DEFAULT_SERVER = "katto-server-production.up.railway.app"` to `DEFAULT_SERVER = "127.0.0.1:8000"`
   - Or log in using the custom server option in the login screen
